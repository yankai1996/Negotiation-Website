    <h3>The Buyer’s Problem</h3>
    <p>
        You are buying a unique product that you can resell for <b>$12</b> in the market. The seller cannot access the market. The market will be available for <b>T = 10</b> periods from now. In each period, either you or the seller will propose a price for this product and the other party will decide whether to accept or to reject the price. If the price is accepted, the negotiation ends; otherwise, the negotiation enters the next period. In each period when you negotiate, you will incur a fixed negotiation cost of <b>$0.1</b>. If an agreement is not reached after T = 10 periods, you will have nothing to sell.
    </p>
    <p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
        There are two uncertainties in this process. First, the party that proposes the price in any period is random. The probability that you will get to propose a price is <b>&beta; = 60%</b> (i.e., 40% chance the seller will get to propose the price). Second, there might be other external buyers who show interest in buying the product. According to experience, the highest price (guaranteed) at which the seller can sell to the external buyers is increasing in the total number of external buyers who show up in the T periods. The relationship is summarized in Table 1. In each period there is a chance of <b>&alpha; = 20%</b> that an external buyer shows up. If the product is not sold to you, the seller will sell it to external buyers at the highest guaranteed price.</b>.

        Your goal is to maximize your profit by deciding what price to offer if you are asked to propose the price, and deciding whether you want to accept the price proposed by the seller.
