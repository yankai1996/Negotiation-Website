    <h3>The Buyer’s Problem</h3>
    <p>You are buying a unique product from the seller. If you obtain the product, you can resell it for $15 in the market. Only
    you can access the market, but it will close in <b>T</b> periods from now. In each period, either you or the seller will propose
    a price for this product and the other party will decide whether to accept or to reject the price. If the price accepted,
    the negotiation ends; otherwise, the negotiation enters the next period. In each period, you will incur a fixed negotiation
    cost of $0.1 unless the negotiation has ended. If the agreement is not reached after <b>T</b> periods, there will be no transaction.</p>
    <p>There are two uncertainties in this process. First, the party that propose the price in each period is random. The probability
    of you proposing the price is <b>&beta;</b>. Second, in <b>&gamma;</b> percent of the games, there is another buyer who will buy the product
    at the price <b>w</b> if the agreement between you and the seller is not reached after <b>T</b> periods. If the second buyer exists,
    in each period, there is an <b>&alpha;</b> probability that both you and the seller will be notified of his existence. It is possible
    that you are in a game in which the second buyer exists but neither you nor the seller knows of his existence until the
    negotiation ends.</p>
    <p>Your goal is to maximize your profit by deciding on how to propose the price and when to strike a deal.</p>
