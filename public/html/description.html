    <h3>The Buyer’s Problem</h3>
    <p>
        You are buying a unique product that you can resell for <b>$12</b> in the market. The seller cannot access the market. The market will be available for <b>T = 10</b> periods from now. In each period, either you or the seller will propose a price for this product and the other party will decide whether to accept or to reject the price. If the price is accepted, the negotiation ends; otherwise, the negotiation enters the next period. In each period when you negotiate, you will incur a fixed negotiation cost of <b>$0.1</b>. If an agreement is not reached after T = 10 periods, you will have nothing to sell.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two uncertainties in this process. First, the party that proposes the price in any period is random. The probability that you will get to propose a price is <b>&beta; = 60%</b> (i.e., 40% chance the seller will get to propose the price). Second, there might be other external buyers who show interest in buying the product. According to experience, the highest price (guaranteed) at which the seller can sell to the external buyers is increasing in the total number of external buyers who show up in the T periods. The relationship is summarized in Table 1. In each period there is a chance of <b>&alpha; = 20%</b> that an external buyer shows up. If the product is not sold to you, the seller will sell it to external buyers at the highest guaranteed price.</b>.

    <h3>The Seller’s Problem</h3>

        You are selling a unique product to a buyer. If the buyer buys the product, he can resell it for <b>$12</b> in a market, which you cannot access. The market will be available to the buyer only for <b>T = 10</b> periods from now. In each period, either you or the buyer will propose a price for this product and the other party will decide whether to accept or to reject the price. If the price is accepted, the negotiation ends; otherwise, the negotiation enters the next period. In each period when you negotiate, you will incur a fixed negotiation cost of <b>$0.1</b>. If an agreement is not reached after T = 10 periods, this buyer will leave.
