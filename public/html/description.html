    <h3>The Buyer’s Problem</h3>
    <p>
        You are buying a unique product that you can resell for <b>$12</b> in the market. The seller cannot access the market. The market will be available for <b>T = 10</b> periods from now. In each period, either you or the seller will propose a price for this product and the other party will decide whether to accept or to reject the price. If the price is accepted, the negotiation ends; otherwise, the negotiation enters the next period. In each period when you negotiate, you will incur a fixed negotiation cost of <b>$0.1</b>. If an agreement is not reached after T = 10 periods, you will have nothing to sell.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two uncertainties in this process. First, the party that proposes the price in any period is random. The probability that you will get to propose a price is <b>&beta; = 60%</b> (i.e., 40% chance the seller will get to propose the price). Second, there might be another buyer that will offer to buy the product at the price <b>w = $17</b>. If such a buyer exists, then in each period there is a probability of <b>&alpha; = 30%</b> she will show up. If she shows up before you reach an agreement with the seller, she will get the product and your negotiation will end. The probability that another buyer exists is <b>&gamma; = 20%</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your goal is to maximize your profit by deciding what price to offer if you are asked to propose the price, and deciding whether you want to accept the price proposed by the seller.

The second buyer may show up after T = 10 periods. The probability that the second buyer exists is <b>&gamma; = 20%</b>. If the product is not sold to the first buyer and the second buyer does not exist, you have to discard the product.
